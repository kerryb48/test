   1. Will, upon completion, generate a text file containing a record of started
  containers, as well as network links between them. These files are used
  by other scripts here
1. docker_kill_clos.sh
   1. Will need the containers record file produced by the start script
1. docker_list_fs_statuses.sh
   1.  Nothing fancy. Iteratively runs /etc/init.d/flexswitch status

   1. Checks the status of network links (VETHs) between containers
   1. Uses the netlinks file generated by the startup script
1. docker_list_veths.sh
   1. Generates a list of all VETHs for the supplied instance names 
   or all, if none supplied.
   1. Used by the docker_check_netlinks.sh
