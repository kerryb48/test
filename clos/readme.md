* Will, upon completion, generate a text file containing a record of started
  containers, as well as network links between them. These files are used
  by other scripts here
### docker_kill_clos.sh
* Will need the containers record file produced by the start script
### docker_list_fs_statuses.sh
* Nothing fancy. Iteratively runs /etc/init.d/flexswitch status
### docker_check_netlinks.sh
* Checks the status of network links (VETHs) between containers
* Uses the netlinks file generated by the startup script
### docker_list_veths.sh
* Generates a list of all VETHs for the supplied instance names 
   or all, if none supplied.
* Used by the docker_check_netlinks.sh 
### docker_make_netlink.sh
* Attempts to make a VETH link pair between named instances.
